Explanation:
Without chomp:

The newline character (\n) at the end of the string is preserved.
Printing the string shows the newline in action: the next part of the output moves to a new line.
With chomp:

The \n is removed from the end of the string.
The string is printed on the same line as the surrounding text.
Key Notes:
If there is no newline at the end of the string, chomp does nothing.
chomp is often used when reading input from files or user input to clean up strings.
Practical Scenario:

 Word : perl || and count :13
